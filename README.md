# landing-page-project
Landing page exercise from TOP

This is a Landing Page Project from TOP. The goal is to build a landing page similar to the design provided from scratch.

Hint:
1. Font being used in the images is roboto.
2. Hero text is the statement that appears at the top of a web page.
3. The website has 4 main sections (and a footer). Starting at the top is always a solid plan.
4. Begin by getting all the content onto the page before beginning to style it. Do HTML then CSS.
5. Do not worry about making your project look nice on a mobile device.
